Multiple pages of documentation refer to the **gh-pages** branch, but it isn't available in the branches dropdown. What gives?

I do see **gh-pages** referenced in the Deployments list, however.

Here are some of the documentation pages that refer to **gh-pages**:
You can just perform a search on docs.github.com: https://docs.github.com/en?query=gh-pages

1. https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site
Strangely, this page doesn't even mention setting the Source attribute in the GitHub Pages section of the repository Settings.

**Note:** If your site's source files are located in the default publishing source—master for user and organization sites or **gh-pages** for project sites—but your site has not published automatically, make sure someone with admin permissions and a verified email address has pushed to the default publishing source.
